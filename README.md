# OpenPhotoTool 📸

**Open source photo management tool for photographers.**

Import, organize, backup, and manage your photos — from SD card to archive.

## Vision

OpenPhotoTool solves the post-capture workflow: from the moment you pull the SD card out of your camera to having your photos safely organized and backed up.

### Key Features (Planned)

- 📥 **Smart Import** — Auto-detect SD cards, copy with resume support
- 📁 **Auto-Organize** — Sort by date, camera, event
- 🔒 **3-2-1 Backup** — Multiple destinations, integrity verification
- 🤖 **AI Features** — Face recognition, auto-tagging, smart culling (local, private)
- 🖼️ **Client Delivery** — Web galleries with selection and download

## Status

🚧 **Early development** — Building the MVP.
